<p>One of the best things about Kali is the fact that it doesn’t require
 you to install the OS in your hard drive — it uses a live image that 
can be loaded in your RAM memory to test your security skills with the 
more than 600 <a href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/top-15-ethical-hacking-tools-used-by-infosec-professionals">ethical hacking tools</a> it provides.</p>
<p>It includes numerous security-hacker tools for information gathering,
 vulnerability analysis, wireless attacks, web applications, 
exploitation tools, stress testing, forensic tools, sniffing and 
spoofing, password cracking, reverse engineering, hardware hacking and 
much more.</p>
<p>We’ve previously explored the <a href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/top-20-intel-tools">Top 20 OSINT Tools</a> available, and today we’ll go through the list of top-used Kali Linux software. Let’s begin!</p>

<p>It allows you to scan wireless networks, searching for security flaws in corporate or personal networks.</p>
<p>Unlike other WiFi cracking tools, Fluxion does not launch any brute force cracking attempts that usually take a lot of time.</p>
<p>Instead, it spawns an MDK3 process which forces all users connected 
to the target network to deauthenticate. Once this is done, the user is 
prompted to connect to a fake access point, where they will enter the 
WiFi password. Then the program reports the password to you, so you can 
gain access.</p>
